Rnn1.py corresponds to q1, Rnn2.py corresponds to q2, Rnn3.py corresponds to q3.

The libraries required are:

bcloz
tqdm
torch
torchinfo
pickle


To run any file, the 'eng-fra.txt' file should be there in a folder 'data', in the same folder where Rnn1.py, Rnn2.py, Rnn3.py 
are present.

To run Rnn3.py which is the 3rd exercise, the folder containing Rnn3.py should also contain a folder labelled, 'gloveData'.
It should contain the embeddings text file which is 'glove.6B.100d.txt'.
